                            Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money that operates on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies like euros or dollars, cryptocurrency has no physical form and is not controlled by banks or governments.

                            Cryptocurrency is based on blockchain technology — a distributed database that stores information about all transactions. The main feature of blockchain is its decentralization: data is not stored on a single server but is distributed across thousands of computers (nodes) worldwide.                  
                        </p>

                        <h3>Key elements of cryptocurrency operation:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Blocks and chains:</strong>
                                <br><br>
                                <p>Each block contains data about several transactions, a unique code (hash), and a reference to the previous block. This creates a chain that cannot be altered without consensus from the entire network.</p>
                            </li>
                            <br>

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>These are essential for verifying the authenticity of transactions:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Proof of Work:</strong> Used in Bitcoin, this mechanism requires computers to solve complex problems to confirm transactions.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li><strong>Proof of Stake:</strong> Used in Ethereum 2.0, it allows participants to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold in the network.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Cryptographic protection:</strong>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>Each transaction is secured by advanced mathematical algorithms, making it nearly impossible to forge or alter data.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            These elements ensure cryptocurrency's security, transparency, and reliability, even without a central governing body.

                                <p>Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Its goal is to become a decentralized alternative to traditional money. Bitcoin is often referred to as "digital gold" due to its limited supply.</p>

                            Traditional financial systems rely on central banks and intermediaries. Cryptocurrency eliminates the need for intermediaries, enabling users to manage their finances independently.

                                <p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin provide a high level of privacy, making them attractive for illegal operations such as trading banned goods, tax evasion, or money laundering.</p>

                                <p>Unlike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies are not regulated by central banks, raising concerns about destabilizing traditional financial systems.</p>
